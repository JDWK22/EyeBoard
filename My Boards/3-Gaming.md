# My Main Gaming Board
While I definitely had some ups and downs through the first two boards I made, I was bound to have a proper victory. At this point in my entrance to the hobby, I had become known as a bit of a keyboard expert amongst my friends. While enthusiast would have been a better word, I was happy to share my experiences with clicky, tactile, and my personal favorite of linear switches with my friends.

Seeing as both of my prior boards had been arguable failures, constantly changing components and configurations, I wanted to have my first attempt at an endgame board. While for many endgame seeks to be the last keyboard you ever built, I had too much fun building them that I knew this mentality was a ruse. Instead, I hoped to create an endgame board, a board that I would never want to change.

## The Kit
By this point, early 2023, preconfigured kits of everything aside from keycaps and switches had not only become common but incredibly well priced and of extreme quality. This is where I first saw this video from [Hipyo Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L49gHgpfaY) about the Wuque Studios Promise 87. While I was not sold about the idea of having a diamond encrusted board, the quality of kit from this company was astounded to me and I wanted in. This brough to my attention the kit that would jumpstart my first endgame board, the Zoom TKL by Meletrix (aka a subbrand of Wuque Studio). Purchasing a preorder (that actually did eventually arrive) I began the journey of building the ultimate monstrosity.

## My Chosen Parts
### Switches
By this point in time, the linear switch genre which I determined to by my favorite had essentially been "solved." A switch composing of a POM stem, polycarbonate top housing, and milky bottom housing was pretty much decided to be the smoothest combination. Since linear switch development had more or less stagnated on this point I figured, "Why pick a perfect switch when instead I can just pick a really good one, but with a funny name," and began looking for a switch that hit most of my criteria of the aforementioned construction. Very quickly I found my perfect switch, a very lightweight (disliked the weight of Tealios switches) long pole (was going to use mostly for gaming) linear switch from well respected manufacturer Gateron, who had just implemented a new and improved factory lubing technique. This switch was none other than the Gateron Baby Raccoon.

I love this switch, the cute white and brown appearance, the funny name, the perfect specs, it was exactly what I wanted for this endgame board, and it was immediately purchased

### Keycaps
Seeing that everything I had ever purchased from KBDFans up until this point had been of top notch quality, they were the first placed I looked when sourcing keycaps for this build.

I am so glad that I searched here first.

When I first learned about GMK keycaps, I saw that there was a set done in 2019, prior to my entrance to the hobby, that I loved. Colored after my favorite Pokemon, Shiny Umbreon, the GMK Umbra set was perfect. Legible white text on a clean grey background, blue text for the modifiers, light blue accents, it was exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately, the set was completely sold out three years ago, cost nearly $400 on secondhand, and was impossible to even find for sale. And then, as if a a divine retribution for me missing out on the GMK Cobalt set, GMK Umbra's designer Pach announced that he was working with KBDFans to create a keycaps set alongside them, a reimagination of the GMK Umbra set named PBTFans Umbra. That's right, for all intents and purposes they were making the exact same color scheme but with a different plastic material (PBT as opposed to ABS) and slightly adjusted color saturation. I was astonished, and immediately ordered the set.

## The Build
The build turned out as perfectly as I wanted it to. I left many items stock, performed the holee and band aid mods from my previous board that I loved, and slapped the kit together to create my primary gaming board. Suring it is a bit large for a gaming keyboard being a TKL, but even as someone who primarily plays FPS games with a very low mouse sensitivity, the size is a non-issue and the spaced out function row is a godsend for preventing accidental presses. I love this board, and even over a year later as of writing this I have not had a desire to replace this board, even though hall effect keyboard technology is quite interesting.

All foams EXCEPT for battery foam - I found this gave the board more of a flex, which I quite like
