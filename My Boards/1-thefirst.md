# My First Custom Keyboard
## How It All Began
Seeing as I began my keyboard journey while already being interested in video games, specifically Overwatch at the time, I already had a couple of keyboards throughout my time. Bouncing between various cheaper membrane options (namely a Razer Ornata, of which I had to have three separate ones shipped before receiving a functional one) and built-in laptop keyboards, I had only ever experienced a mechanical keyboard once. While at a friends house, his older brother had recently purchased a generic Red Dragon 60% board with some variety of blue switch and was keen on showing it off. Instantly, I was mesmerized. The sound, the distinct end of a keypress, the smaller footprint compared to my full size Ornata, this experience was game changing.

Fast forward about two years and I had begun the process of sourcing parts for my own keyboard. At the time of starting, premade kits for building a board were either overly expensive or simply difficult to obtain, with the primary budget method available to me being sourcing each individual part, entirely custom. Knowing that I wanted a board for gaming without sacrificing the arrow keys, I began sourcing the parts for my first board, based off the DZ60 RGB PCB.

While this initial build is nowhere near how this board sits today (which we will get into eventually) it did set me off on the path of learning my tastes. Unfortunately, this involved learning that the loud and obnoxious Kaihl Box Jade's that I had chosen were not exactly what I was into. Keycaps chosen were another dull point, as the SA profile (tall and molded) was not exactly enjoyable for gaming. However this did set me off into learning a lot about keyboards.

## The First Board's Evolution
Over the years, a wide range of new and old parts have made their way onto this board, although it did remain as-is for quite a while. Upon starting my second board, this first one became outfitted with very poor quality DSA keycaps (a shorter, still molded version of SA). This was due to me re-using the SA profile keycaps as part of my second built. Eventually this first board saw a full re-build, switching to a more standard Cherry profile keycaps set from KBDFans (who will be a VERY common recurring entity in my builds) alongside Tecsee Sapphire tactile switches that I hated, quickly changing the switch it is currently using, Gateron Milky Yellows.

While I appreciate this board, it spends a majority of its life sadly on a shelf. When I do go somewhere public where I don't want to bring a heavier or nicer board it is very nice to have, but ultimately it lives its life on a shelf displaying the beautiful KBDFans Klein Blue keycaps set bestowed upon it.
