# The entry to typography
After creating the prior gaming-centered keyboard, I more or less exited the hobby for around 1.5 years. In that time I never saw any new releases that interested me as I had ultimately completed my perfect keyboard for daily use. However, something was missing. A major portion of the hobby I had yet to dip my toes into.

## Tactile Switches
While I had tried feeling them before, tactile switches never stood out to me as something that could be preferential. I know that nearly every keyboard enthusiast touts how tactile switches are superior for typing, but since a large majority of my use case is gaming the tactile switch just felt like something to stand in the way of a smooth keystroke. Despite this, I wanted to build a collection not just throw all of my money away when building keyboards. And for a collection, there was a major hole; I had no boards with tactile switches. Between this and my university major of Technical Communications (due to a love for typing and educating) I sought to create a board designed specifically for typing, while also taking my first dive into non-standard layouts.

## The board
Since most typists and writers generally stick to the characters relating to language, a 60% keyboard tends to make sense. Were I dealing with numbers frequently then a larger size would make sense, but I also wanted to keep portability in mind so 60% it was. When looking for high quality, relatively budget conscious board kits from reputable manufacturers is the goal, the Tofu60 2.0 easily stood out at the time. This board also allowed me something new to try, the HHKB layout.

Aside from trying out an actually HHKB topre board at a meet, I have never tried non-standard keyboard layouts before. Despite this, the changes to caps lock and delete/backspace were extremely interesting to me. Being able to reach some of my most used keys without straining my pinkies and wrist sounded amazing.
