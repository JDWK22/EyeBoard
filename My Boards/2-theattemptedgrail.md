# The Attempted Grail
After building my first keyboard, I figured I could do better. Kits are becoming more common now, but no. I can source my parts better on my own.

How naive, and little did I know that a true money pit was about to follow...

## The initial component selection
This keyboard has never and likely will never see a finalized vision come to fruition. My initial idea for this board was a red theme, to combat my initial blue keyboard made with relatively generic blue and grey SA keycaps. Do to this, I chose the blank slate of the KBD75. This gave my back my function row that I had decided I missed when using a 60% (Function rows are for nerds, I had told myself at the time), forced me to learn to solder (as hot swap KBD75 PCB's were note readily available at time of purchase) and had a simple muted black coloring. While I started off using the SA blue and grey set from my first board, i eventually had found a red Star Wars DSA dye-dub keycaps set from NovelKeys.

Paired with ZealPC Tealios V2 linear switches, holee and band aid modded Durock V2 stabilizers, and plenty of foam I thought I had created the most perfect keyboard ever.

### I f***ing hate keycaps
These Star Wars keycaps were much worse than I had though would be possible for a product. Mis-centered lettering, warped keys causing stabilizer interference, inconsistent coloring, I was disappointed to say the least. As an attempt to patch together this attempt I placed the SA set back on this board and looked into a different blue set, doubling down on my love for the color blue. It was here that we first learned about a company that would fundamentally change how I looked for new keycaps;

#### GMK

That's right. I saw on Instagram from SMKeyboards that he was collaborating to make a layered acrylic case to pair with the set GMK Cobalt. I was in love. Blue lettering on a grey backdrop was perfect, and being able to custom order a keyboard case to match this set was something I could never pass up. Wanting to make my fairly lackluster second board more interesting, I jumped on this opportunity, placing my case order through SMKeyboards and my GMK Cobalt order through none other than Mechs&Co.

While I won't dive into details, the incredible case from SMKeyboards arrived and the GMK Cobalt set was utterly scammed from my arms, as M&C proceeded to cease all customer contact and close down business without every fulfilling my order. Since then I have attempted multiple keycaps inside this board, but have never been able to find something that fits as well as I'm sure GMK Cobalt would. I will continue this search as this board means a lot to me. A custom commissioned case and the PCB that taught me to solder (eventually swapped out for a hot-swap alternative for ease of use) is something I will hold onto for years to come, and once again taught me what it is about keyboards that I truly enjoy.

### Other issues with the board
Keycaps weren't the only issue I have encountered with the board. Another main issue I had to overcome was that the USB-C port on my PCB slowly and surely began to die. Phantom inputs would appear, genuine inputs would randomly disappear, and occasionally the keyboard would just entirely cease to function. To remedy this, I purchased a newly released hot swap variant of the keyboard. After de-soldering the entire board and rebuilding it on the new PCB, it was fully functional again. However, repeatedly remove every switch had caused some wear-and-tear on the acrylic casing from SMKeyboards. Some keys wobble and fall out, and once this keyboard has keycaps to complete it tackling this wobbly plate issue will also be of high importance. It saddens me to have such a nice and important to me board be in such a rough spot.

## The future of this board
While much of the above story may seem quite cynical, I do hope to one day return this board to the glory it deserves. This board helped me learn a lot. I learned to solder on this board, I learned the technique for various mods that I still use on new boards, and it even taught me to never trust a company. Every few days I will look through popular keyboard marketplaces looking for a keycaps set that I would deem worthy of being placed on this keyboard. Until that keycaps set is found, this keyboard lives its life in a case in the corner of my closet, protected from dust.
