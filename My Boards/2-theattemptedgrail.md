# The Attempted Grail
After building my first keyboard, I figured I could do better. Kits are becoming more common now, but no. I can source my parts better on my own.

How naive, and little did I know that a true money pit was about to follow...

## The initial component selection
This keyboard has never and likely will never see a finalized vision come to fruition. My initial idea for this board was a red theme, to combat my initial blue keyboard made with relatively generic blue and grey SA keycaps. Do to this, I chose the blank slate of the KBD75. This gave my back my function row that I had decided I missed when using a 60% (Function rows are for nerds, I had told myself at the time), forced me to learn to solder (as hot swap KBD75 PCB's were note readily available at time of purchase) and had a simple muted black coloring. While I started off using the SA blue and grey set from my first board, i eventually had found a red Star Wars DSA dye-dub keycaps set from NovelKeys.

Paired with ZealPC Tealios V2 linear switches, holee and band aid modded Durock V2 stabilizers, and plenty of foam I thought I had created the most perfect keyboard ever.

### I f***ing hate keycaps
These Star Wars keycaps were much worse than I had though would be possible for a product. Mis-centered lettering, warped keys causing stabilizer interference, inconsistent coloring, I was disappointed to say the least. As an attempt to patch together this attempt I placed the SA set back on this board and looked into a different blue set, doubling down on my love for the color blue. It was here that we first learned about a company that would fundamentally change how I looked for new keycaps;

#### GMK

That's right. I saw on Instagram from SMKeyboards that he was collaborating to make a layered acrylic case to pair with the set GMK Cobalt. I was in love. Blue lettering on a grey backdrop was perfect, and being able to custom order a keyboard case to match this set was something I could never pass up. Wanting to make my fairly lackluster second board more interesting, I jumped on this opportunity, placing my case order through SMKeyboards and my GMK Cobalt order through none other than Mechs&Co.

While I won't dive into details, the incredible case from SMKeyboards arrived and the GMK Cobalt set was utterly scammed from my arms, as M&C proceeded to cease all customer contact and close down business without every fulfilling my order. Since then I have attempted multiple keycaps inside this board, but have never been able to find something that fits as well as I'm sure GMK Cobalt would. I will continue this search as this board means a lot to me. A custom commissioned case and the PCB that taught me to solder (eventually swapped out for a hot-swap alternative for ease of use) is something I will hold onto for years to come, and once again taught me what it is about keyboards that I truly enjoy
