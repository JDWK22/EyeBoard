# Welcome to EyeBoard
Ever since I first had access to a computer, I became infatuated with video games. Now being a relatively shy kid in the 2010's, I'm sure that notion is a surprise to absolutely nobody.

Through this interest in video games, my attention was naturally also directed towards other subgenre interested associated with video games. What gaming headset is the best, what gaming mouse is the best, what anything is the best. Eventually during my third year of high-school I asked a question that would fundamentally change my hobbies; what keyboard is the best?

This question set me off on a path of computer related hobbies. As a way to record and track these hobbies and improve my documentation abilities, I created EyeBoard to keep everything in one place. Here you can find stories of my keyboard builds, blogs of other endeavors, and reviews of various components.

Cheers, and thanks for reading!
